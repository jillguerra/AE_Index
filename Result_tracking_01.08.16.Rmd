The current results 

- some heavy skew & kurtosis (look at excel sheet)
- very clear negativerelatioship between nochem and fertilizer. 
- some relationship  between fert and covercrop/croprot/apm
- credit and associated positively related 
- crop rot and direct planting somewhat positively related 
- interesting negative relationship between associatedand credit and nochem. Seems to show that more associatedness and access to credit will actually lead to higher levels of agrichem useage. 
- soil not great because I don't know what it means! 

- scale with:
orgcompost, manure, covercrop, croprotation, apm, lowtill, soil and drip had alpha of 0.47 NOT GOOD
